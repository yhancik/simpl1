        <section id="intro">
            <p>I'm on the outside looking inside, what do I see? Much confusion, disillusion all around me. I talk to the wind; my words are all carried away. I talk to the wind; the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear.</p>
            <p>You don't possess me, don't impress me, just upset my mind. Can't instruct me or conduct me. Just use up my time.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="section1">
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams. Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams. When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams, will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams?</p>
            <p>Confusion will be my epitaph as I crawl, a cracked and broken path. If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh. But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying. Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying</p>

        <section id="section2">
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>Call her moonchild, dancing in the shallows of a river. Lonely moonchild, dreaming in the shadows of a willow</p>
            <p>Talking to the trees of the cobweb strange, sleeping on the steps of a fountain. Waving silver wands to the night-bird's song, waiting for the sun on the mountain.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="section3">
            <h2>Section 3</h2>
            <p>The keeper of the city keys put shutters on the dreams. I wait outside the pilgrim's door with insufficient schemes. The black queen chants the funeral march. The cracked brass bells will ring to summon back the fire witch.</p>
            <p>In the court of the crimson king, aah aah, aah aah aah!</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="section4">
            <h2>Section 4</h2>
            <p>Sundown dazzling day, fold through my eyes. But my eyes turned within only see starless and
bible black.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="section5">
            <h2>Section 5</h2>
            <p>Plato's spawn cold ivied eyes, snare truth in bone and globe. Harlequins coin pointless games, sneer jokes in parrot's robe. Two women weep, Dame Scarlet Screen sheds sudden theatre rain whilst dark in dream the Midnight Queen wnows every human pain.</p>
            <p>In air, fire, earth and water, world on the scales. Air, fire, earth and water, balance of change. World on the scales, on the scales.</p>
